    </h2></header>
    <p class ="date">25th June 2020</p>

    <header><h3>My core values</h3></header>
    </p>
    <p class ="content">
      <em class ="lead-statement">Personal Advocacy</em> <br>
      I value being an advocate for myself and supporting others 
      (regardless of their abilities) to be their own advocates too. This is 
      empowerment for me and I love the sense of clarity and relief that comes from being 
      around others who I know will advocate for themselves. </p>
    <p class ="content">
      <em class ="lead-statement">Relationships</em><br> I do things like scheduling specific time with my partner purely 
      so we can check in and feed our relationship, I enjoy working on relationships with my family, and prioritize booking 
      in times to see or skype friends. I tend to see my relationships as projects and as such I try to  step into and learn 
      from the discomforts I encounter in relationships and try to bring an openness to learn from them. I am often told I am 
      a present listener which I believe helps build important relationships. </p>       
    <p class ="content">
        <em class ="lead-statement">Connection </em><br>Similarly to relationships, I value keeping connections healthy and 
        ‘alive’. I think appreciating and meeting the dynamism that exists in, and between, individuals allows us to fully 
        experience ourselves, each other and the changing world around us.
    <p class ="content">
            <em class ="lead-statement">Humour </em><br>It’s so important for me to be able to laugh, whether on my own or 
            with others. I find it a powerful and transformative reaction to my situation and one that allows me to step back 
            and often enjoy the intricacies and ‘mishaps’ in life.
    <p class ="content">
                <em class ="lead-statement">Sustainability</em><br>I enjoy and practice considering sustainability in relation 
                to the personal, interpersonal, environment relationships we have. It affects my choices for example when it 
                comes to food, e.g. meat, eggs and organics. It also affects the choices I make when it comes to how I spend my 
                time, where/how I spend my money, how I get around, my career, how I plant my garden etc...
    <p class ="content">
                <em class ="lead-statement">Transparency and equality </em><br>I believe that responsible participation and 
                choices can be made when we have transparency. I like the idea of minimising the place that assumptions, 
                judgement and coercion have in our thinking, in our homes, workplaces, communities, politics etc. I love to 
                think that with access to transparent information, people will innately want to do good things!
     <p class ="content">
                    <em class ="lead-statement">Honest communication</em><br>I am passionate about communication as a tool for 
                    building trust and growth potential in the relationship we have with ourselves and in relationships we have 
                    with others. I truly believe honest communication can be a very real expression of kindness and compassion, 
                    though this does not always mean it is either easy to hear or easy to deliver. <br>
        
    <br><header><h3>An ethical decision making process</h3></header><br>
    <p class ="content"> I have come from working in the disability
         support field, where I was part of a recently established 
         co-worker support team. The team was made up of people of 
         different experience and qualifications. <br><br>A core value of 
         our organisation, and of my own, was that we work with as 
         flat a managerial structure as possible. This meant we 
         expected each coworker to carry the same amount of 
         responsibility, influence and consideration. This meant 
         that each person’s role was described the same and included 
         the same ‘duties’ - direct support, home upkeep and managerial.
         <br><br>In light of the equal expectations and therefore commitment 
          from each coworker, when the discussion turned to pay I voted 
          at all coworkers should be paid the same, despite any 
          experiential or educational differences. <br><br>Subsequent to the 
          decisions of  pay being made (with unanimous agreement) the 
          government decided to increase the wage for anyone holding a 
          certain level 4 qualification in this field. Some of our team 
          held this qualification, and some did not, however the Trust 
          who employed us could not afford to raise all of our pay to 
          the now governmentally advised rate. <br><br>In order to keep us all 
          on the same pay wage and to abide by the legal increase in 
          rate for those employees who held the qualification, I and 
          the team voted to share the difference in wage’s evenly 
          between us so as we all remained on the same rate. <br><br>This 
          decision making process was based upon some core values of - 
          equality, honest communication, sustainability, connection 
          and relationships. <br><br>I believe in finding ways for people to 
          share their experience and expertise in ways that supports 
          the growth of the whole team, it feels celebratory and not 
          dividing for the team dynamic. With transparency, rather than 
          discipline, I believe we motivated the team members to 
          understand and strive to improve their abilities to meet 
          the values and responsibilities within their roles. <br><br>I love 
          this idea of working, finding ways to ignite intrinsic will to
           do good work as an individual as part of a team, rather than 
           relying on extrinsic factors (i.e. money) to produce good work.
        </p> 
       <br> <header><h3>My culture and its influence</h3></header><br>

       <p class ="content"> I grew up with 3 siblings and 2 parents. We 
         were so fortunate to also have many cousins, aunties, uncles 
         and all four of my grandparents close by. My memories of my early years include 
         collective child rearing, generous open door policies and good honest hard work.<br><br> 
         On my mother's side (around whom we spent most of our time) there was always enough for everyone, 
         and never too much. A humble life allowed for non-attachment and plenty of time to offer. I felt 
         warm, nurtured and part of a really cool and growing tribe being with my nana and pop, who were 
         guardians and supporters to many more beyond their family - often people more vulnerable. I fondly 
         remember how Pop in particular had a special affinity for Maori culture/tikanga and had close 
         friendships with the local iwi. <br><br>My family are a sporty bunch and practicing and playing sports 
         as a young person was a core learning and cultural experience for me. I played both individual 
         and team sports and think I learned a lot about discipline, comradery and community through 
         these pursuits.<br><br> I also attended a cathloic primary & intermediate school, despite my family not 
         being practicing catholics. I deeply appreciate having had an introduction to some form of 
         spiritualism as a young person, having school as both an intellectual gymnasium as well as one 
         where I could exercise and learn about a common human belief, ethical and moralistic paradigm, 
         albeit a relatively narrow one.
         <br><br>Later in life I have immersed myself in different cultures, particularly for the last three years 
       working and living amongst people with strong ethos around self care, people care and environmental care. 
       
       
        This culture with its focus on relationships, the sustaining and sharing of resources and strong connection to the 
           use of our time and the consequences of our actions has hugely shaped and clarified my personal values. </p>
         
           <br><header><h3>My strengths and limitations</h3></header><br>
           <p class ="content"> I have identified as an ‘Empathic Idealist’, a term used in the Big Five Personality Test. Listed below are some attributes that the test described, some that I have come up by myself and some that people close to me have shared.

          <br><br><em class= "lead-statement"> I feel strong because I:</em>
<ul class = "content">
    <li>Use insight and creativity to help others.</li>
     <li>Think about how the world could be a better and more beautiful place.</li>    
<li>Have a highly creative and imaginative way of thinking and I often see connections that others do not.</li>
<li>Am uninterested in the dull facts of a situation, preferring instead to interpret its meaning and implications.</li>
<li>Have unusual ideas and sometimes perceive things that other people are not aware of.
</li>
<li>Am easily absorbed by fantasy and enjoy envisioning alternate realities as well as possibilities for the future.</li>
<li>Am preoccupied with goal-setting and achievement and most of my thoughts revolve around planning and completing tasks. 
</li>
<li>Am a structured, orderly thinker, and rarely waste time on unproductive daydreaming.
</li>
<li>Want to distinguish myself but not step on any toes to do so
</li>
<li>Value intellectual challenge, depth of thought, and insight
</li>
<li>Place great value on artistic and cultural endeavours
</li>
<li>Believe that the improvement of the mind is an important and worthy goal
</li>
<li>Am competitive - I love a good game and some healthy competition. It might result in a slammed door or two if I lose, but most of the time I’m able to enjoy the heck out of a close match, especially in table tennis!
</li>
<li>Am caring and kind - I’m thoughtful and often find myself considering how and working to make other’s lives better
</li>
<li>Love being prepared for and thorough with my tasks/activities
</li>
<li>Am observant and have good situational awareness. I often notice where things are in a space as well as having a read on how people are.
</li>
<li>Am sentimental. I attach great meaning to things I do and people I share my life with. 
</li>
<li>Am persistent, don’t give up easily.
</li>
<li>Identify as a good ‘grunt person’ who loves working with and optimises the skills of big ideas people
</li>
<li>Am resourceful, I love finding solutions to problems with the things I have on hand. Finding multiple uses for things is so fun for me!
</li>
</ul>            

<br><br><em class= "lead-statement"> As it goes, my strengths also act as some of my biggest limitations:</em>
<ul class = "content">
    <li>Thoroughness can lead to perfectionism and preoccupation with details
    </li>
    <li>Preparedness can lead to firm expectations, struggles with change and uncertainty. I can also struggle to let go of control in situations which is a disservice both to me, in terms of being able to receive from others, and to others who have less of a chance to take initiative or ownership of tasks. 
    </li>
    <li>The nature of my care and love for others also means I tend to feel great, and at times unhealthy, responsibility for other people’s wellbeing and my affect on them - which I often assume is detrimental. It is an exhausting, sometimes suffocating and largely unnecessary tendency.
    </li>
    <li>Attaching great meaning to things can often mean I lead my life quite emotively and my feelings are more vulnerable and therefore I can be volatile, moody and seemingly irrational. According to the Highly Sensitive Person Test I took, I am highly sensitive! I see this as helpful information and supportive when it comes to designing my life and making sense of some of my reactions to things. It is both a strength and a challenge.
    </li>
</ul>

<br><header><h3>My learning and career development in light of my strengths and limitations</h3></header><br>
        <p class = "content">I think I am more likely to succeed with my learning and career development when I utilize my strengths and support my limitations through awareness and design. I believe my 
          determination, longing for intellectual stimulation, love of people, preparedness and care for sustainability and wellbeing are all benefits 
          when it comes to learning and working. <br><br>When I am able to cater to my limitations, for example by planning my day in certain ways, I believe I 
          an become less and less inhibited. Having supportive friends/whanau, understanding of my feelings and needs and having healthy ways to 
          process and meet these makes my world a much kinder and enjoyable place to inhabit. <br><br>When I take care of myself and my sensitivities and 
          involve others (but not depending on them) I believe I am fun and enjoyable to be around and a great addition to any team. I am fairly 
          adaptable and find I can often provide balance to different learning and working situations, as long as I consider balance within myself 
          first!  
        </p>
<br><header><h3>How my strengths will support my learning</h3></header><br>
<p class ="content">In particular I think my persistence, understanding of my own emotional tendencies and my continual striving to better understand 
  and support myself are all having an amazing impact on my ability to learn. <br><br>I think I am more able to detach my self worth or identity from the 
  hings I’m struggling with and I think this is a very crucial step for me to open myself up for learning. <br><br>I now consider the ways in which I was
   identifying and building my self worth to be fragile. In place of achievements and production, I try to presence myself in my process, attitude and general 
   rientation to be what I take pride in. <br><br>Often, if I consider the transient, more fragile and situationally dependent as less important , I can 
   connect to myself (my values & connectedness) easier and then actually do end up being more productive, collaborative and confident in meeting 
   learning challenges!
</p>

<br><header><h3>Working with resistance or tension</h3></header><br>
<p class = "content">In the team meetings at my most recent workplace, many of us experienced regular tension and resistance. 
  <br><br> When we considered 
  this, we acknowledged that we actually all care so much about the work we do - both because we all take personal pride in doing good work but
   also because this particular work engages so much of our emotional selves, as well as our practical/ intellectual shelves, as it is so 
   relationship oriented. Many of us also live in the community in which we work so our sense of care and responsibility was likely even higher. 
   <br><br>So once we realised we were dealing with people with emotional investment in the organisation and in the relationships we were discussing, we
    decided to structure our meetings differently to cater to the multiple needs. We designed meetings so that we had a moment to presence
     ourselves at the beginning, then we each had an opportunity to have a personal check in to let others know anything that is going on and 
     so to allow us to really be present at the meeting. We then had a chunk of time for practical notices and following this, an opportunity 
     to share some gems/ challenges and learnings from our time with the 3 men with intellectual disabilities who we support. This is often where
      the tears, celebrations and real emotional support for carers came in and to me this was the most important part of the meeting! We would 
      discuss the challenges of the work, moments of shame that might have arisen over the week and then of course the relief that comes when 
      most often we all would say, “me too!”. Time for deeper reflection and development came later in the meeting. <br><br>We found that by clearly 
      scheduling times for ‘head’, ‘heart’, ‘hand’ type conversations made it easier for us to engage more appropriately at each point in the 
      meeting, to truly meet each other in celebration and grief, and also to stay on track and stick to time.
