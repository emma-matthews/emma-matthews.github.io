    <header><h3>What Emotional Intelligence is for me</h3></header>
    </p>
    <p class ="content">
      
        There are a lot of different definitions of emotional intelligence out there, and I love the diversity in interpretations. 
 
        For me emotional intelligence describes a series of practices:
        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">The practice of ‘seeing’ and allowing emotions:</em><br> The practice and 
        ability to identify and acknowledge one's own emotional experience and how it exists in us. In our bodies, 
        in our communication, in our thoughts etc.

        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">The practice of distancing, conscious re-framing and gratitude:</em><br>
        In facing our emotions, we recognise our proximity to them as a choice. For example, will I become and identify 
        this emotion, or will I allow it to be, just as it is, without willing it to be different and thank it for the 
        information it is providing me? I view emotions signals, just as we use our well known 5 senses to inform how 
        we are and can be in the world, I think our emotions can allow us to know and learn about ourselves in different 
        contexts. They are information for and about us, rather than they are us.

        
        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">The practicing a present, yet non-attachment relationship the emotions we experience:</em><br>
        We can practice this ourselves and learn to extend this practice to others. We can start to hear beneath people's words and often guess their under acknowledged feelings and their unmet and very human needs. 

        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">The practice of meeting others and their expressions with compassion and curiosity:</em><br>
        To me, emotional intelligence extends to supporting others to meet themselves as we try to meet ourselves, observing the tragic 
        expressions of unmet needs and meeting those with compassion and curiosity. Is there an invitation I can extend to this person 
        that may support them in their own understanding, expression and meeting needs?

       <br> <br><header><h3>What I think the difference between Emotional Intelligence and IQ is</h3></header>

        <p class = "content">My understanding is that IQ is a measure of a person's ability to reason using abstract logic and 
        rationale. It will determine a person's speed and accuracy as it comes to solving complex cognitive tasks and relies on functions 
        like attention, the formation of knowledge, memory and working memory, judgment and evaluation, reasoning and "computation", 
        problem solving and decision making, comprehension and production of language. <br><br>

        It is different to emotional intelligence both in the processes it more heavily relies on, e.g. learning, abstract and spatial 
        thinking compared to perception/evaluation and expression. IQ seems to rely on more tangible, inert and measurable elements while 
        emotional intelligence relies on largely unseen, animated and dynamic elements that exist within and between people
        </p>
        <br> <br><header><h3>Why I think Emotional Intelligence is important</h3></header>
        <p class = "content">Emotional intelligence is important as it allows for greater understanding, ability and process and therefore 
            choice as it comes to experiencing and expressing emotions throughout life. In the workplace it can nurture collaboration, service, 
            initiative, creativity and leadership. In the home it can do the same, it can enhance and nourish relationships and I believe it 
            can impact overall wellness. It can often inform us of the reasoning and motivations for desiring certain things and making 
            certain choices. <p id= "final-statement">I think the power of understanding what determines our choices is incredibly empowering as it grants us the opportunity 
            to effectively support the changes we want to see in our lives.<p>
