    <header><h3>When I think about my long term goals,</h3></header>
    </p>
    <p class ="content">
      
      I want to combine my experience and interest in human skills with a hard and practical skill such as web development. It has been a delight so far in the course to experience the employment of what feels like both parts of my brain - the more black and white side and the more colourful creative side. I would love to have a career working in a diverse team, developing ethically minded tech while maintaining a great work/life balance. My income will ideally sustain me to live a relatively simple life, with quality/low impact possessions and well sourced food. It will allow me to explore my other interests in communication, small business, nutrition, disability support provision and sustainable living. One of my dreams is to live in a lush, off grid tiny home, tend a small garden, have a generous amount of time to offer a community and to have a balance of onsite and home-office tech work. </p>
      <br><header><h3>And the human skills I want to develop..</h3></header>
      <p class ="content">
        I look forward to building a more complimentary way of working in teams. I want to become skilled in using personal and team routines and rituals that ensure we are all cared for and thriving in a work environment. I want to be able to respond to different personalities, to listen to what it is they want to grow for themselves and really try to make space where I can for them to do so.</p>       
        
        <br><header><h3>I start to think about my strengths and limitations,</h3></header>
    <p class ="content">
      I’m a deep thinker and big feeler. I am quite competent when it comes to learning most things. I enjoy building structure into my days and like a more organised rather than chaotic approach to most tasks/activities. I can get tied up in details and become a bit too attached to a certain outcome rather than allowing a more organic process. I also attach big meaning to the things that I invest my time and energy into and as such can suffer when things go differently than I imagined or wanted them to or when others don’t share the same feelings as I do.  
</p>
<br><header><h3>And how I will manage the workload in this programme. </h3></header>
<p class ="content">
  I am committed to using my organizational strengths and preference for preparation to manage my workload. Being able to respect time frames that I have set is hugely important. Being able to switch off after a chunk of work has been done, step away or  hand over is also key. I like to use scheduling tools like google calendar and my newly acquired pomodoro timer and I enjoy the relief of knowing that there is an unbiased entity keeping me accountable. Being aware of the health of my ego, my health and my colleagues is also important and having routine check in’s will also help keep things in perspective for me. Lastly, gaining perspective by remembering the promise I made to myself when joining this course which is that I am here to enjoy learning a new skill to support my wants and needs for my life. I am not here to hurt myself or others in the pursuit of perfection.
</p>
<br><header><h3>I make sure I can and will seek help quickly if I need it, </h3></header>
<p class = "content"> I have a very aware personal support team who I have no trouble turning to quickly if I need some empathy or emotional support. I am also looking forward to establishing a relationship with the cohort and facilitators/support people so that if I need help I will have already established an ease of conversation. </p>

<br><header><h3>And describe what I expect from those holding the course. </h3></header>
       <p class = "content">I expect the facilitation team to support the vision of my learning journey as best as they can while ensuring they are well and cared for themselves. I always appreciate people in a holding position to be able to communicate clearly and honestly both as it relates to work and personal expectations. I find it more relaxing and supportive to be around people who can respectfully advocate for themselves and this is what I expect from the facilitation team too.</p>
<br><header><h3>I'll take care to organise my time wisely, especially since I'm going on holiday.. </h3></header>
       <p class = "content"> I am going to be away from home for 11 days during foundations and so I have communicated this with the facilitation team and am scheduling my study around this. I hope to do a couple of hours a day for about 8/11 days and have a pretty lenient schedule for the weeks after my return which will hopefully cater to my catchup.</p>

<br><br><header><h3>And while I do all of this, I'll always remember my 'whys' and allow myself to enjoy the process! </h3></header>
