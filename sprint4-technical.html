    <header><h3> Realising the Solution is Simple </h3></header>
    </p>
    
  
        <br> 
        <p class ="content">
            Even during the short time that I have been coding (a matter of weeks), I have realised that many of the problems I have encountered have been far more simple to solve than I expect.
            As an attempt to build healthy practice with coding, I am beginning to build up a default response when I face a problem. It usually goes something like this:
            <br><br>

            <ol class= "content">
                <li>Swear (quietly), and feel any disappointment
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Greet any stories and feelings of failure with an big hug and a cup of tea
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Ensure the feelings have received my empathy and have de-escalated.     
                </li> 
                <br>
                <li>Gauge a realistic impression of the size of the problem and begin to test out some easy solutions while trying to remain in a <a class = "hyperlink" href = "https://emma-matthews.github.io/sprint4-cultural.html">mindset of curiosity</a> as opposed to stress or panic
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>By this time I can actually read  and comprehend the error message now that it seems less insulting, I approach it as a friend pointing me in the right direction and I’ll try and take its advice
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>I’ll look for simple typos or errors. For example spelling mistakes, missing capitalization or any obvious inconsistencies with my syntax
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>I’ll usually need to check in with my emotions at around this point, and TRY and greet this unexpected challenge as an awesome opportunity for growth, jeez this is becoming an emotionally laborious task.. I thought we were just coding FFS!
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Emotions in check, I now consider deploying some of the big guns which I’ll list and detail more below. Usually my go-tos are console.logging, reading the instructions out loud and then chatting with google. But again if I’m stressed I’m usually blind to the obvious so taking some deep breaths is essential.

              </ol>
        
        <br> <br><header><h3>What Does Solving a Problem 'Elegantly' mean to me?</h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br>Solving a problem elegantly for me means that I have remained in a relative state of calm, retaining my ability to hear, see and think ‘straight’ and am keeping any tendencies of frantic and/ or panic driven behaviour at bay. Usually the outcome in these situations looks like easy to read, considered, well formatted and concise code.
        
        <br> 
        <br>
        <header><h3>The Big Guns of Problem Solving:</h3></header>
 
        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">Pseudocode-</em><br>
        <p class = 'content'>
        Using comments writing in 'human language' to outline to structure of the function before coding it out.
<br><br>
            I like this approach because it helps me get my thinking straight. It ensures that I have understood what the function is going to do and breaks down the process into more palatable bite sized pieces. It is like planning ahead and I think this ultimately saves time.

        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">Trying something-</em><br>
        <p class = 'content'>
            Having an honest go and using your own undetstanding and creativity to try a different approach.
            <br><br> 
        I think this approach supports my independence and confidence as a coder. It encourages me to look at the challenge from different perspectives and call upon learning and experiences I have had before.
        
        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">Rubber ducky method-</em><br>
        <p class = 'content'>
            This is about explaining the problem out loud in order to use different parts of your cognition to understand it.
        <br><br> 
        I don't have a rubber ducky, but I find that by speaking and hearing back both the challenge and the problem that I am working on,
         solutions or new ideas can magically find their way to my mental inbox. Whether it is about using the auditory pathway or explaining what's going on in new words, the benefits of this practice are usually reward me with the answer or at least a clearer idea of the problem.
    
            <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">Reading error messages-</em><br>
        <p class = 'content'>
            Error messages may look like gobbledygook, but usually some of it is decipherable and could even be helpful!
        <br><br>
        Sometime, as afore mentioned, if I'm in a panic error messages can be intimidating and confusing - like someone yelling at you in a foreign language. In actual fact, approach cooly, error messages are actually trying to help and give you directions. So step aside the culture shock and trust the intentions of this seemly foreign speaking machine, I find when I do I am usually rewarded by a huge hint about where I am going wrong in my logic. 
        
        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">Console.logging-</em><br>
        <p class = 'content'>
        Chucking in a classic console.log() can help display what information can be revealed by the machine - or something similar to a status upate.
        <br><br>

        I like this approach because it's quick and usually quite helpful. For example, if it is a string or array I'm trying to work with then knowing what these actually look like can help me on my way.
      
        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">Googling-</em><br>
        <p class = 'content'>
       Infinite numbers of legends from our industry have faced similar, if not the same, problems in their time as ours and have shared their solutions for the benefit of everyone. How lovely is that? So the art involved here is understand the problem enough to dig out key words that will lead you to the google result that will be your saviour. Google is so full of stuff that being both specific and careful about your wording is important and prevents some of the overwhelm that can result from scrolling pages and pages of different results.

        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">Asking your peers for help-</em><br>
        <p class = 'content'>
        I sometimes find this hard, especially while in foundations as my peers are not so familiar to me. But when I have summond my courage and reached out I have been rewarded with both super helpful hints and usually a lovely human connection. Undoubtedly, we'll talk about other things, have a laugh and 5 or 25 'me too!' moments. 
        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">Asking coaches for help-</em><br>
        <p class = 'content'>
        It is a similar experience to asking my peers for support, except I'm more inclined to go down this route because I assume that coaches asking question is more expected. 
        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">Improving your process with reflection-</em><br>
            <p class = 'content'>
        There is always something to be learnt in every experience, to find out what this is reflective practices are a great way to start. It is like harvesting all the goods from an experience where you have invested time and effort. Obtaining a yeild from even the most annoying or frustrating of experience feels good, and propels us to go further.
