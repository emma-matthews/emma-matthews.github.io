    </h2></header>

    <header><h3>Neuroplasticity & what it means for us </h3></header>
    </p>
    
  
        <br><em class ="lead-statement">I think that the main way that neuroplasticity is helping people, is by challenging and ultimately changing their belief systems.
        </em><br> 
        <p class ="content">
        Before neuroplasticity, the thinking about the brain and learning was very static and limited. Understanding and believing (both things that can be supported by science) that our brains 
        are malleable and influenced hugely by where we place our focus offers empowerment to literally make choices about what we want our brains to do 
        rather than being at the mercy of a ‘concrete’ brain.<br><br>

        Learning about this property of brains, I have been able to approach my personal healing journey and new learning adventures in a drastically new 
        way. It has equipped me with a much needed faith that things can change, that my consciousness can help support that change and that my 
        intentions can be magic in changing the behaviours that do not serve my wellbeing, and in growing those that I would like to nurture in my life.
        
        <br> <br><header><h3>Increasing Neuroplasticity</h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">Imagination - </em><br>
        Using your mind's eye is a powerful way to excite those all important neurons. Retracing car rides, walking through your hometown, imagining playing and instrument and what your fingers are doing. 
        With purely your mind and your memory of experiences you can engage neurons that work in concert to perform tasks, and through doing so actually strengthen them!
 
        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">Practice-</em><br>
        Physical practice/ repetition can strengthen those neurons and behavioural
        patterns too.

        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">Reflection-</em><br>
        I think there is a reason that Dev Academy stresses the importance of reflection so much. Reflections helps us consolidate learning, orient ourselves for better learning in the future 
        and reinforce new learning patterns/behaviors.
        
        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">Contextualising-</em><br>
        Plasticity and learning can happen more effectively when relationships between existing and new learning can be created. These relationships establish a sound context and a supportive environment for strengthening both old and new knowledge.

        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">Knowing that it is possible!-</em><br>
        Our beliefs are huge determinants for what we can see and achieve in the world. Subconsciously our beliefs are sculpting our views, our confidence and our decision making. Tapping in to their power and weeding our those beliefs that don’t support us to be what we want to be helps us mold our brain into the friend we want it to be. Our mind really does affect our matter!

        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">Lifelong learning-</em><br>
        This is super helpful for keeping brains agile and malleable. Continual learning might look like practicing a new language, challenging any static attitudes or beliefs you have, and picking up a new instrument.
      
        <br><br><em class ="lead-statement">Brain Gym (aka Educational kinesiology)-</em><br>
        This uses movements that require both sides of your brian to work in a fun way together. Based upon the interdependence of movement, cognition and applied learning, Brain Gym states that movements, exercises or activities often bring about improvement in social, cognitive and motor skills (e.g. concentration, memory, relationships, physical coordination).

       <header><h3>The Growth Mindset and why it matters </h3></header>
       <p class = content>
       <br><em class ="lead-statement">Growth mindset is a conscious state of mind that promotes learning and growing</em><br>
       Growth mindset is competed with by Fixed Mindset which is a state of mind driven by the belief that what is will always be and that our brains are static and therefore we are limited to its current parameters. It is extremely relevant to all of us to know the difference and to acknowledge that we have a choice to engage in one or the other- it is not always easy, in fact it is usually really hard because the fixed mindset is often reinforced through childhood learning and exists in the subconscious brain which is usually harder for us to catch in action.
        <br><br>
        Like neuroplasticity, a growth mindset is achieved by noticing and choosing where we want to place our focus. Where our attention lies, will actually determine the patterning in our brain and our experience. Mindfulness, or observing oneself are the gateways to identifying our choices and I think this is empowering, and a huge responsibility which I wish for everyone to take on. Taking off the shackles on our minds, we are returned to the state of overflowing potential and become vehicles for unlimited possibility as if we are children again. How amazing is this!
        <br><br>
        Taking this forwarded in my learning journey, I want to practice observing what narratives pop up, particularly in response to challenges. By observing these narratives, many of which I imagine to be self-deprecating or self-limiting, I hope I can practice applying a bit of growth mind-set balm and rephrase these narratives to more adequately support the wishes I have for myself and how I want my learning journey to be!
