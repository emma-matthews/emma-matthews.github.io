    </h2></header>
    <p class ="date">31 July 2020</p>

    <header><h3>What new things have I learned about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning? </h3></header>
    </p>
    
  
        
        <p class ="content">
          I have a really strong wish to be strong for myself and for others to be able to advocate for themselves too.<br><br>

          I have learned how essential it is to make and take time for my emotional reactions and experiences when learning and eventually when working too <br> <br>
          When my feelings are validated, my ego is more agreeable and my sense of general empowerment and self assuredness is elevated.<br>
        <br><header><h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br>They are the foundation upon which any sill or acquisition of knowledge is built upon. These components of a self are what we can rely on and turn to at anypoint in our learning and working journey. They provide answers to the question of ‘Why’ we are doing what we are choosing to do and are the source of our most precious inner orientation. 
 
        <br>
        <br><header><h3>What has surprised me the most about core learning?</h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br>How limitless this learning is, and how it is as much a continuously evolving practice in which the learning occurs through both inner and outer observation.  
        <br>
        <br><header><h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br>Having honest yet kind conversations with myself in order to grow in the ways I want to. Not looking away too quickly even when it is uncomfortable!<br>
        <br><header><h3>Why do I think EDA, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br>I think Dev understands the relationship that ‘work’ has with the rest of our life. The model of learning that they are promoting seems to encourage us to care for our ‘work-selves’ as well as we would like to look after ourselves in the other areas of life. Infact, I believe Dev Academy rebuts the distinctions between work and non-work as well-being doesn’t abide by such distinctions. Being well as a programmer promotes well-being elsewhere in life and also sets us up well for a balanced and sustainable career in tech. I wish other industries did the same!

        <br>
        <br><header><h3>What is my long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br>I want to work in the tech industry as part of a team, preferably remotely. I would love to work on projects that align with my values, particularly sustainability and community well-being. I have aspirations to be a team leader of sorts and possibly even try my hand at being in a facilitation or in a role that employs the use and sharing of human skills.

        <br>
        <br><header><h3>What do I think my biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br>Speed learning, and moving on with the pace of the course even if I would prefer to stay and dive deep into a particular topic. I think I will enjoy spending time working with people. I am hoping that my focus and trust in myself will keep me strong through the process.


        <br>
        <br><header><h3> How do might the values I spoke of in week 2 think help or hinder me during Bootcamp?</h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br>I look over the values that I wrote about in week two and I still feel greatly bonded to them. Trust is another value I’ve been calling on a lot during foundations. Trust that I have made a good decision, trust that what I don’t understand at first glance will soon make sense to me, trust that fulfilling my needs (like food, sleep, outside time and companionship) is ultimately in support of my goal to do well in this course. I think that by trusting myself and listening to the signals I get from my body will allow me to get the most out of this course. I’m nervous that I may interpret my body telling me it needs a break as lack of motivation or even ‘laziness’ but trust in myself is what I will need to call upon to truly look after myself during the process.


        <br>
        <br><header><h3>What might my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp be?</h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br>Balancing my time and nurturing important relationships in my life while also doing bootcamp. I am in the midst of a big life change, my partner and I are in the process of finalising the purchase of a home and I want to allow myself to celebrate this milestone with him. With his support at home, I’m hoping that I will get through bootcamp with a steady mindstate but I am nervous that stress points that I encounter along the way may put stress on our interactions. I’m mindful of this and will feel really proud if I can proceed through this journey with grace.

        <br>
        <br><header><h3>What non-technical skills do I want to develop while at EDA?
        </h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br>I want to grow in my ability to manage my time well and stay true to the plans and goals I set myself. I want to show myself that I am able to take care of myself in a physical sense during bootcamp too. I just really want it to be an all round growthful and enjoyable journey.



        <br>
        <br><header><h3> What are some areas for development you would like to work on?
        </h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br>I really want to practice honest an kind communication when it comes to giving feedback. I still want to work on changing my idea of feedback being a hard thing to it being an act of generosity and comradery. I would also like to build healthy reflective habits to help my process each day so I can meet the next in a ready state.

        <br>
        <br><header><h3> What are my expectations of myself on Bootcamp?
        </h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br>I expect that I will arrive in each state having prepared myself for a day of learning. I want to turn up open, receptive and with a big engagement. I want to make sure that I make space for myself to take time building relationships with others, having a laugh alongside doing ‘the work’. I expect that I can have an awareness of both the task at hand and the people/environment around me.

        <br>
        <br><header><h3> How and where will I seek help in a timely way?

        </h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br>I will use the check in times with both the Human Skills Facilitator and my tech-in person to express any concerns. I will practice reaching out to my peers in the course (my experiences doing that during the foundations course have been greatly rewarding). I will also be sure to communicate with those outside of the course who have offered their help i.e my brother Nick and friends Stan and Mischa.

        <br><header><h3> My commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme.

        </h3></header>
        <p class = "quote">
        <br> "I will manage my time during boot camp in a number of ways. Before launching into a task/assignment I will reference the guidelines set out by our facilitators. I will also honor an overall structure for the week in which I will have time off at lunch time, evenings and Sundays. I will allow myself to consciously change my overall ‘work times’ only if I have considered my life commitments and well being first. I will use the pomodoro timer to ensure I am having small breaks while doing a task and I will communicate my plan and availability to my teammates if working on a team project. "</p>
