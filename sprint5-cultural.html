    <header><h3>What new things have I learned about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning? </h3></header>

        <p class ="content">
          I have a really strong wish to be strong for myself and for others to be able to advocate for themselves too.<br><br>

          I have learned how essential it is to make and take time for my emotional reactions and experiences when learning and eventually when working too <br> <br>
          When my feelings are validated, my ego is more agreeable and my sense of general empowerment and self assuredness is elevated.<br>
        <br><header><h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br>They are the foundation upon which any sill or acquisition of knowledge is built upon. These components of a self are what we can rely on and turn to at anypoint in our learning and working journey. They provide answers to the question of ‘Why’ we are doing what we are choosing to do and are the source of our most precious inner orientation. 
 
        <br>
        <br><header><h3>What has surprised me the most about core learning?</h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br>How limitless this learning is, and how it is as much a continuously evolving practice in which the learning occurs through both inner and outer observation.  
        <br>
        <br><header><h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br>Having honest yet kind conversations with myself in order to grow in the ways I want to. Not looking away too quickly even when it is uncomfortable!<br>
        <br><header><h3>Why do I think EDA, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3></header>
          <p class = content>
        <br>I think Dev understands the relationship that ‘work’ has with the rest of our life. The model of learning that they are promoting seems to promote caring for our ‘work-selves’ as well as we would like to look after ourselves in the other areas of life. Infact, I believe Dev Academy rebuts the distinctions between work and non-work as well-being doesn’t abide by such distinctions. Being well as a programmer promotes well-being elsewhere in life and also sets us up well for a balanced and sustainable career in tech. I wish other industries did the same!
